## Django Nuxt SSR

**Note**: README.md is the same on both backend and frontend repositories (locally symlinked).

[backend repo](https://github.com/SHxKM/django-vue-ssr) | [frontend repo](https://github.com/SHxKM/django-nuxt-ssr-front).

### TL;DR

A simple (now realtime) to-do app built with: Django REST framework, Django Channels, Nuxt.js, and Tailwind.

### About 

Django To Do With Vue v2 is an expirement in utilizing technologies and practices in web development that I haven't used before.

This project is over-engineered on the one hand, and not really production-ready on the other (you can help with that). My goal wasn't to build a todo app per se, but to expirement with all the "cutting-edge" stuff out there.

It can serve as a general template, but is not to be relied upon to utilize best practices in produciton.

### Stack

- backend:
    - Django
    - Django REST framework
    - Django Channels
- frontend:
    - Vue
    - Nuxt.js
    - Tailwind CSS

### Heroku

After many failed attempts to deploy the codebase as a single repository, I've
 finally came to the conclusion that it's not only wrong, but also quite cumbersome.
